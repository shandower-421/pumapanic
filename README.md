# PumaPanic

**Cyber Castle Panic** — A single-player turn-based card game where you defend your network from cyber threats.

Inspired by [Castle Panic](https://firesidegames.com/products/castle-panic-second-edition) by Justin De Witt, re-themed around IT security operations.

## Play

[pumapanic.greykit.com](https://pumapanic.greykit.com)

No install required. Single HTML file, runs in any modern browser.

## How It Works

Your network is represented as concentric rings — **Internet** (outer), **Perimeter**, **Network**, **Endpoint**, and **Core** (center). Six servers sit in the Core, protected by six firewalls. Threats spawn on the Internet ring and advance inward each turn, destroying firewalls and servers as they go.

Each turn you draw security cards and play them to block threats. Cards must match both the **ring** and **network segment** of the threat you're targeting. Special cards like Contractors, Honeypots, and Quarantines give you flexibility when your hand doesn't match.

You win by defeating all threats in the deck with at least one server still standing.
